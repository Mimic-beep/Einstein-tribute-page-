     <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
    <h4>Physicist. Scientist. Genius. (1879–1955)</h4>
 
    
        <h1>Sypnosis</h1>
        <p>Born in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany in 1879, Albert Einstein had a passion for inquiry that
             eventually led him to develop the special and general theories of relativity.
             In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric 
             effect and immigrated to the U.S. in the following decade after being targeted by the Nazis.
             Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century, with
             his work also having a major impact on the development of atomic energy.
             With a focus on unified field theory during his later years, 
             Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey

    <span>Born to Hermann Einstein (a featherbed salesman) and his wife Pauline in Ulm, Germany.</span><br><br><br>

    <label for="1884">1884-</label>
    <span>Receives his first compass around this time, inspiring a lifelong quest to investigate mysteries of the natural world.</span><br><br><br>

    <label for="1889">1889-</label>
    <span>Settles into a program of self-education at age 10 and begins reading as much about science as he can.</span><br><br><br>

    <label for="1894">1894-</label>
    <span>Stays on in Munich to finish the school year after his parents move to Pavia, Italy. Lasts only one term on his own and then follows his family to Italy.</span><br><br><br>
   
    <label for="1895">1895-</label>
    <span>Attempts to skip high school by taking an entrance exam to the Swiss Polytechnic, a top technical university, but fails the arts portion. His family sends him to the Swiss town of Aarau to finish high school.</span><br><br><br>

    <label for="1896">1896-</label>
    <span>Graduates from high school at age 17 and enrolls at the ETH (the Federal Polytechnic School) in Zurich.</span><br><br><br>

    <label for="1898">1898-</label>
    <span>Falls in love with Mileva Maric, a Serbian classmate at the ETH.</span><br><br><br>

    <span>Graduates from the ETH.</span><br><br><br>

    <label for="1901">1901-</label>
    <span>Becomes a Swiss citizen and, unemployed, searches for work. Meets Maric in northern Italy for a tryst, and she becomes pregnant. In the fall, he finds work in Schaffhausen, Switzerland as a tutor. Maric, visibly pregnant, moves to Stein am Rhein, three miles upriver. She then returns to her parents' home to give birth to her child. Einstein moves to Bern.</span><br><br><br>

    <label for="1902">1902-</label>
    <span>In January, Maric gives birth to their daughter, Lieserl, whom they eventually put up for adoption. Lieserl reportedly becomes ill, and then all record of her disappears. Einstein takes a job at the Swiss Patent Office. Hermann Einstein becomes ill and dies.</span><br><br><br>
